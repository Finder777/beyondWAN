    <h2>What on earth is that?</h2>
    <p>This is the first story of many.  I can't imagine what having an anxiety disorder means but I have seen it in my wife.  She struggles with it and her face contorts everytime it grips her.
        It's that horrid fear of something being wrong. She is convinced that she can smell a bonfire and somehow no-one else can smell it.
        Such a particular thought.  She read that smelling bonfires is a sign of a stroke and now of course she is convinced that she can smell a bonfire.  It is pretty fucked up but what can I say?
        Seriously what can I say? I'm raising 2 kids, I feel exhausted most of the time and now she is sat there telling me she can smell a bonfire.  I don't know where to start, how the hell do you
         actually pick this up?
