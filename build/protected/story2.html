    <h2>Que mas Paisa?</h2>
    <p>one of the hardest feelings that I have to deal with is that of dispondency and hate.
      A great-uncle of mine lives in poverty.  He survives because my mother sends him money. No pension, no income, no reliable family to support him.
      Life can be shit and push people to the point of starvation. Desperation even.
      How hard it is to imagine just how difficult it is eat, buy some gas for cooking and pay rent when you do not actually have an income.  The apartment that you rent is the same size as a single garage.  It is split with a father and son living in it, a toilet, shower, kitchen, small wardrobe and 2 double beds with a curtain separating it.
      Day-in, day-out.
      The grind of a room that serves as your entire existence.
      The misery of it and yet somehow you have to carry on.  When I visited my uncle and I stayed with him, we shared the double bed and his son was in the other double bed.  I didn't know where the fuck my cousin was most of the time but he seemed to be out all the time just doing nothing.  He has a severe speech impediment so his pronunciation was well off and he has the mental age of a 9year old child. What the fuck could he actually be doing all day long? He wasn't working a 9 to 5 but he sometimes came back with cash.  No idea where it came from.
      Tio watched his tv in the corner of the room, a horrid blue light with the tin sounding speaker of colombians speaking at 100mph. It was a small space and obviously felt different to what I was used to. I just wanted to sleep to disappear but it was hot and I couldn't get that heavenly, deep sleep that comfortable surroundings provide.
      The noise of the street was loud in my eyes and I felt the smog drifting into the room.  I slept knowing that actually, Tio was looking after me and that meant everything to me.
      The poverty is painful but at least they were surviving, even if the conditions were tough.
      Was I just being strange because I grew up in relative comfort? No.  I felt the discomfort of sleeping pretty rough many times beforehand and I am a huge fan of camping.  Furthermore, life in the Army meant that I could sleep anywhere more or less.  But it wasn't anything like that.
      It was the fact that it is my beloved Uncle who was living like this. I had heard so many stories about him from my mother and her uncle that  I had clung dearly onto his legendary status.  This was it.  His life.  I finally stepped into his world and my heart broke instantly.  It was a dark, dreary place and I felt stupid as fuck.  Not because of him but because I finally got it.
      I spent so much of my life up until that point not really knowing where I fit in but know I understood.  I understood that the world is a cunting place willing to destroy.  Your life means nothing to anyone really.
      I remember waking up, having some masamora then heading down to the lock-up.
      I had expected a workshop and there was one behind a locker.  At the time I did not really speak any Spanish so everything came to me without words or warning or explanation.  It was better that way so I could see it properly without interference.
      Life will give you nothing and I could see the pain of desperation in my uncles expression as he stood in his garage doorway, waiting in hope for a customer so that you can do a bit of work and earn a bit of money.  It's fucking humiliating.  I could see that the world wants to humiliate us.
      Humiliate me and my family. All those cunts with money are waiting there to humiliate us because we can't eat and they just fucking piss their money away.
